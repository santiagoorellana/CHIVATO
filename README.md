CHIVATO 1.3

The CHIVATO app
It is an application for monitoring the connection of storage devices to the computer (Memories, external drives, internal drives, CD, DVD, Phones). Very useful for controlling the business of copying packages and information in general. With its use you will be able to expand your business by employing other workers without the fear of being robbed. The program is protected by password (password) access so that only the owner of the business can control it. The main features of this version of the application are:

It shows in a list all the storage devices that have been connected to the computer and for each of these it shows:

* Device name (Example: JUAN, CHICHO, CUCA2).
* Serial number of the device.
* Device type (Removable, Internal, CD-ROM).
* Date and time you connected.
* Number of minutes connected.
* Device capacity (In Giga Bytes).
* Amount of data copied to the device (In Giga Bytes).
* Amount of information it had when connecting (In Giga Bytes).
* Amount of information it had when disconnecting (In Giga Bytes).
* Minimum amount of information that the device had (In Giga Bytes).
* Files that were copied to the device during connection.

It allows you to view the list of devices by day, week, month or year, showing useful statistical data for business management in a window, such as:

* Total number of devices according to their type.
* Total Giga Bytes copied to all devices.
* Total Giga Bytes copied to each type of device.
* Hours of the day in which more connections are made.
* Days of the week or month in which more connections were made.
* Total amount of copied files and amount according to their type of extension.

The monitoring result can be exported to a text, xls or web file, and saved in a memory so that the business owner can review them later on another computer. It can also be exported to XML and INI formats so that the data can be read by other programs.
And much more…

The application runs automatically every time Windows is started and surreptitiously monitors device connections without users noticing. Only the owner of the business will be able to see the application, opening it with a secret password.
The CHIVATO app was created with package copiers in mind, to give them an opportunity to grow their business. Take advantage of it…
